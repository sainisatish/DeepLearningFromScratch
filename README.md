# DeepLearningFromScratch
Learning Deep learning from scratch using books(As suggested by Tensorflow- https://www.tensorflow.org/resources/learn-ml) and courses from coursera(https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning).
So here I will create small programs from scratch using python and tensorflow.

1- IMDB binary classification
2- Reuters multiclass classification
3- Boston House price prediction
4- Keras Sequential and Functional API
5- Convolutional Neural Network
6- Cat vs Dog classifier
